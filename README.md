# (Re)port (Pub)lisher

Serialization types for structured inputs.

## Overview

`repub` allows you to create classes that can accept structured data and output
simple reports in various formats:

- LaTeX files
  - PDF files generated therefrom
- HTML pages
  - Jupyter notebook previews
  - Stand-alone HTML pages with embedded multimedia
  - HTML directories with media in separate files
- Text files
- Rich Slack messages

Simple structure can be encoded into type definitions, allowing for simple but
pleasantly formatted reports to be automatically generated in multiple output
formats.
